Create a public load balancer with an IP-based backend using the Azure portal
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a public load balancer with an IP based backend pool.
A traditional deployment of Azure Load Balancer uses the network interface of the virtual machines. With an IP-based backend, the virtual machines are added to the backend by IP address.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
•	Create a virtual network
•	Create a NAT gateway for outbound connectivity
•	Create an Azure Load Balancer
•	Create an IP based backend pool
•	Create two virtual machines
•	Test the load balancer
Prerequisites
•	An Azure account with an active subscription. Create an account for free.

In this section, you'll create a virtual network for the load balancer, NAT gateway, and virtual machines.
1.	Sign in to the Azure portal.
2.	On the upper-left side of the screen, select Create a resource > Networking > Virtual network or search for Virtual network in the search box.
3.	Select Create.
4.	In Create virtual network, enter or select this information in the Basics tab:
Setting	Value

In this section, you'll create a NAT gateway and assign it to the subnet in the virtual network you created previously.
1.	On the upper-left side of the screen, select Create a resource > Networking > NAT gateway or search for NAT gateway in the search box.
2.	Select Create.
3.	In Create network address translation (NAT) gateway, enter or select this information in the Basics tab:

9.	Select the Review + create tab, or select the blue Review + create button at the bottom of the page.
10.	Select Create.
Create load balancer
In this section, you'll create a zone redundant load balancer that load balances virtual machines. With zone-redundancy, one or more availability zones can fail and the data path survives as long as one zone in the region remains healthy.
During the creation of the load balancer, you'll configure:
•	Frontend IP address
•	Backend pool
•	Inbound load-balancing rules
1.	In the search box at the top of the portal, enter Load balancer. Select Load balancers in the search results.
2.	In the Load balancer page, select Create.
3.	In the Basics tab of the Create load balancer page, enter, or select the following information:
Setting	Value
Project details	
Subscription	Select your subscription.

4.	Select Next: Frontend IP configuration at the bottom of the page.
5.	In Frontend IP configuration, select + Add a frontend IP.
6.	Enter LoadBalancerFrontend in Name.
7.	Select IPv4 or IPv6 for the IP version.
 Note
IPv6 isn't currently supported with Routing Preference or Cross-region load-balancing (Global Tier).
8.	Select IP address for the IP type.
 Note
For more information on IP prefixes, see Azure Public IP address prefix.
9.	Select Create new in Public IP address.
10.	In Add a public IP address, enter myPublicIP for Name.
11.	Select Zone-redundant in Availability zone.
 Note
In regions with Availability Zones, you have the option to select no-zone (default option), a specific zone, or zone-redundant. The choice will depend on your specific domain failure requirements. In regions without Availability Zones, this field won't appear.
For more information on availability zones, see Availability zones overview.
12.	Leave the default of Microsoft Network for Routing preference.
13.	Select OK.
14.	Select Add.
15.	Select Next: Backend pools at the bottom of the page.
16.	In the Backend pools tab, select + Add a backend pool.
17.	Enter myBackendPool for Name in Add backend pool.
18.	Select myVNet in Virtual network.
19.	Select IP Address for Backend Pool Configuration.
20.	Select IPv4 or IPv6 for IP version.
21.	Select Add.
22.	Select the Next: Inbound rules button at the bottom of the page.

25.	Select Add.
26.	Select the blue Review + create button at the bottom of the page.
27.	Select Create.
 Note
In this example we created a NAT gateway to provide outbound Internet access. The outbound rules tab in the configuration is bypassed as it's optional isn't needed with the NAT gateway.

Setting	VM 2
Name	myVM2
Availability zone	2
Network security group	Select the existing myNSG
Install IIS
1.	Select All services in the left-hand menu, select All resources, and then from the resources list, select myVM1 that is located in the TutorPubLBIP-rg resource group.
2.	On the Overview page, select Connect, then Bastion.
3.	Select the Use Bastion button.
4.	Enter the username and password entered during VM creation.
5.	Select Connect.
6.	On the server desktop, navigate to Windows Administrative Tools > Windows PowerShell.
7.	In the PowerShell Window, run the following commands to:
•	Install the IIS server
•	Remove the default iisstart.htm file
•	Add a new iisstart.htm file that displays the name of the VM:
PowerShellCopy
 # Install IIS server role
 Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools

 # Remove default htm file
 Remove-Item C:\inetpub\wwwroot\iisstart.htm

 # Add a new htm file that displays server name
 Add-Content -Path "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\iisstart.htm" -Value $("Hello World from " + $env:computername)
8.	Close the Bastion session with myVM1.
9.	Repeat steps 1 to 7 to install IIS and the updated iisstart.htm file on myVM2.
Test the load balancer
1.	Find the public IP address for the load balancer on the Overview screen. Select All services in the left-hand menu, select All resources, and then select myPublicIP-LB.
2.	Copy the public IP address, and then paste it into the address bar of your browser. The default page of IIS Web server is displayed on the browser.
 
To see the load balancer distribute traffic to myVM2, force-refresh your web browser from the client machine.
Clean up resources
If you're not going to continue to use this application, delete the virtual network, virtual machine, and NAT gateway with the following steps:
1.	From the left-hand menu, select Resource groups.
2.	Select the TutorPubLBIP-rg resource group.
3.	Select Delete resource group.
4.	Enter TutorPubLBIP-rg and select Delete.
